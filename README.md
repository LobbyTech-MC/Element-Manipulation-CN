# Element Manipulation
this addon gives the players the capacity to create elements from items, and items from elements
this addon is still in a beta, it only has 3 recipes, that are:
Hydrogen from water (deconstructor)
Oxygen from water (deconstructor)
water from these two elements(junction table)

## For the server owners

I will add a way to config how many energy the machines uses, and a way to configure elements that
element collector can colect
(element collector is coming soon)
